Prediction models, Optimization, Transportation and Logistic Process 



# # Motivation
<p>The movement of goods and services from place to place has been of ageless economic importance to both developing and developed nations. This section of human endeavour has called for countless and relentless researches to achieve an optimal performance in any transportation processing. Moreso, the advent of sophisticated technological innovations has set in motion an unending demand to develop predictive models to monitor and optimize transport and logistic processes. 

Our quest is to apply data analytics techniques to discuss the effective analytic methods of monitoring transport and logistic processes as well as to develop an optimal path to predict possible delivery time for a particular transportation leg.

The economic importance of these are: 
<ul>
<li>To salvage up to 15 % of annual expenditure accuring to transportation cost of moving goods by effective management of freight delivery processes(air transportation)</li>
<li>To reduce the $CO_2$ (Carbondioxide) emission accountable to the transportation industry.</li>
<li>To predict the delivery time for a particular freight transportation process.</li>
</ul>
